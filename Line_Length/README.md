# Description

Implement a C program that calculates the length of a line formed by a sequence of points in the ordered two-dimensional space. The program should read in the standard text input an integer **N**, which represents the number of points that make up this line. Then read **N** real number pairs, representing a **P(i)** point of the line in **2D** space. Print on the screen the length of the line, considering that the points are reported in an orderly manner. Write the length value to **4** decimal places.
