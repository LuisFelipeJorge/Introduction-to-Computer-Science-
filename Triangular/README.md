# Description

A **triangular number** is a natural number that can be represented as an equilateral triangle. It was developed by *Gauss* in 1788 when he was only 10 years old. Implement a C program that reads a positive integer in standard text input. Make sure that this number is a triangular number. If so, write the word **“YES”** on the screen. Then write the next triangular number on the screen. Then check if the sum of the number given in the entry and the next triangular number found is a square number (If yes, write **“YES”** again, otherwise, write **“NO”**). In case the entry number is not a triangular number, just write the word **“NO”**.
